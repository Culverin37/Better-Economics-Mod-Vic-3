Confidence: Having more Loyalists than Radicals, having high Legitimacy, having low Taxes, having the Laissez-Faire law, having high cash reserves in Industrial and Tertiary buildings, having Volatility between 0 and 10, having a low Interest Rate and having recently had a Recession or Depression.\n\nThe following #red decreases#!

This is reduced with Religious Universities, who also increase attraction to the Devout State-Wide.\n\nA high concentration of Barracks and Naval Bases in a state increases attraction to the Armed Forces statewide.\n\nState Churches in Urban Centres increase Devout attraction among Urban Pops.\n\nHaving a low level of Urbanization increases Petite-Bourgeoisie attraction state-wide, while a high urbanization increases it for Trade Unions and Industrialists.\n\nHeavy Industry (construction goods), Logging and Mines increase worker attraction to Trade Unions while decreasing it for Petite-Bourgeoisie and Independent Workers.\n\nMilitary Industries increase owner and worker attraction to the Armed Forces.\n\nLight Industry (consumer industries) slightly increase worker attraction to Trade Unions.\n\nTertiary Industries increase worker attraction to Independent Workers, Petite-Bourgeoisie and Intelligentsia. Intelligentsia are further boosted by Creative Industries.\n\nFinancial Centres have workers and owners more drawn to the Industrialists, and all pops working in Financial Centres can be attracted to the Industrialists."

 pec_intro.7.t:0 "Influence Ideology and Assassinate"
 pec_intro.7.d:0 "PEC adds two new character interactions: Influence Ideology and Assassinate, with the Arrange Accident option removed.\n\nInfluence Ideology can be used on Interest Group Leaders and the Heir in a monarchy. Influence Ideology gives you a chance to change the character's ideology, either to the current rulers' ideology or towards a list of semi-random ideologies depending on the Interest Group in question. The chance of Influence Ideology working is dependent on Interest Group approval. It costs Authority, and in democratic systems will also decrease Legitimacy.\n\nAssassinate is an option for any character who is not the country's ruler. The interaction requires either Secret Police, or National Guard with an authoritarian system. The chance of success and the chance of being discovered are independent of each other, and improve with higher Secret Police or National Guard institution investment. Secret Police is better at not being caught (having no chance of being caught at maximum investment level), while National Guard is better at getting the job done (having no chance of failure at the maximum investment level)."
